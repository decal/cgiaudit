	cgiaudit is a general-purpose, "black box" CGI auditing tool. This program probes HTTP 
servers for well-known CGI vulnerabilities by parsing HTML form elements and deriving attack 
requests from them. Each of these requests represents a different vulnerability. Once these 
requests are sent, the server response and following document are parsed for evidence of successful 
penetration. This "evidence" is configurable by regular expression in the cgiaudit.conf file. A 
sane example is included. Other features include a built-in spider, proxy support, and hexadecimal
encoding of requests.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
Please read cgiaudit(1) and cgiaudit.conf(5).

Note: This program is similar is some ways to Lluis Mora's HTTPush and rfp's 
RFProxy (presented at CanSecWest). The chief advantage of this software package
is that it functions without user interaction at runtime and includes many more
features.
